Find students who are in 3rd grade and have 5 points for all their courses. 
The output should consist of the student names only in alphabetical order.
best_student = "
SELECT St.name
FROM Students AS St
JOIN Student_Subject as SS
ON St.student_id = SS.student_id
WHERE st.grade = 3
GROUP BY st.student_id
HAVING AVG(SS.result) = 5
ORDER BY st.name;" 



Find four students with the most achievement points and list their names in alphabetical 
order with their scores. The student's year is not critical. The output should have only 
the name and the bonus point column. The output should be in descending order of the bonus point column.

achievement_point = "
SELECT St.name AS name, SUM(A.bonus) AS [bonus point] 
FROM Student_Achievement AS Sa 
INNER JOIN  Achievement As A
ON Sa.Achievement_id=A.Achievement_id 
JOIN Students AS St  
ON St.Student_id=Sa.Student_id 
GROUP BY Sa.student_id ORDER BY SUM(A.bonus) DESC LIMIT 4;"  


If the student's average is over 3.5 points for courses, output above average in the best column. 
Otherwise, print below average. Order the results in alphabetical order by name.

average_student = "
SELECT St.name,
CASE
WHEN AVG(SS.result)>3.5 THEN 'above average'
ELSE 'below average'
END AS best 
FROM Students AS St 
JOIN Student_Subject AS SS 
ON St.student_id = SS.student_id 
GROUP BY SS.student_id 
ORDER BY St.name;"


You have to find the best students. The course averages of these students are above 4.5 points. 
The result should be in ascending order by name, with their names and which department they are in.
best_of_department = "
SELECT St.name, D.department_name 
FROM Students AS St 
JOIN Student_Subject as SS
ON St.student_id = SS.student_id 
JOIN Department AS D 
ON St.department_id = D.department_id 
GROUP BY SS.student_id 
HAVING AVG(SS.result)>4.5 
ORDER BY St.name;"
